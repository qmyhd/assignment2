        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about? \n",
        "  \n",
        "  The paper focuses on the concept of data tidying as a crucial component of data cleaning. The paper aims to make data cleaning more efficient by proposing a standardized structure for datasets, making them easier to manipulate, model, and visualize.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish? \n",
        "  \n",
        "  The \"tidy data standard\" aims to create a specific structure for datasets that simplifies data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. It is intended to make the data cleaning process more effective and efficient.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  The first sentence means that tidy datasets all share certain characteristics that make them tidy, but messy datasets can be messy in many different ways. The second sentence means that for a specific dataset, it is often straightforward to identify which components are observations and which are variables. However, coming up with general, precise definitions of observations and variables that apply across all datasets is tricky.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Wickham defines values as the actual data points or numbers. Variables are the characteristics or attributes about which data is collected. Observations are a single record or unit describing an instance of the variables collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Tidy data is defined as data where: Each variable has its own column, each observation has its own row, and each value has its own cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are: Column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables stored in one column. Variables stored in both rows and columns. Multiple types of observational units stored in the same table. A single observational unit split across multiple tables. The data in Table 4 is messy because the column headers contain values, not variable names. Melting is the process of turning columns into rows to tidy a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because variables are stored across both rows and columns. Table 12 is tidy and molten because each variable now has its own column, with each observation in a row.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "  The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem is that tidy data is only useful if tools exist to work with it, but tidy tools will be limited by the tidy data structure. So they are interdependent, making it hard to improve one without the other.Wickham wishes for ongoing teamwork to find new ways of defining tidy data, moving beyond minor upgrades. He also wants more research on how people understand data analysis, using user tests and similar approaches."
